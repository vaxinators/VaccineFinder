## Overview
### Description
VaccineFinder is an app to help users find available appointments to get a COVID-19 vaccine near them.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Health
- **Mobile:** This app could be viable both on the web and on mobile. However, a mobile experience would provide users with additional features such as being able to set notifications to remind you of your appointment, or when a location has more appointments available. 
- **Story:** Allows users to conveniently find an appointment and remind them as needed. It could also remind them to check their local government website and ensure all the proper forms are filled out prior to their arrival.
- **Market:** Anybody who currently qualifies for the vaccine are potential users. The potential user base is also expanding as eligibility expands nationwide.
- **Habit:** An average user would use this app a few times until they are vaccinated.
- **Scope:** This app could start by simply presenting all available appointments through the API and evolve with more features to make more of the vaccination process managed in the app.
